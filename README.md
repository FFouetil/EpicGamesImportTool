# EpicGamesImportTool
A tool that allows to import previously installed games, mostly useful when they disappeared from the library after a reinstall

At the moment, it's roughly functionnal.
1/ Pick a folder and click Scan to search for Epic Game entries in all subfolders.
2/ Click Import to add all found games to your EGL library.

When you open the Epic Game Launcher afterwards and go into your library, it will take a little while to scan, validate, and fix missing metadata for every game you just added.
